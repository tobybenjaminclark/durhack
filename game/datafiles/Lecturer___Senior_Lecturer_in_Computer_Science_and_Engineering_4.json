Yes, we are a large organisation with a diverse and talented community; a community doing extraordinary things. But what makes us different is not only what we do, it is how we do it. Together, we are driven to be thoughtful, practical, and purposeful in all we do. If you want a career where you can thrive, be challenged, and do meaningful work, you are in the right place.\n\nUNSW has three strategic priority areas. Firstly, a drive for academic excellence in research and education. Universities are often classified as \u2018research intensive\u2019 or \u2018teaching intensive\u2019. UNSW is proud to be an exemplar of both. We are among a limited group of universities worldwide capable of delivering research excellence alongside the highest quality education on a large scale. Secondly, a passion for social engagement, which improves lives through advancing equality, diversity, open debate, and economic progress. Thirdly, a commitment to achieving societal impact and translation through sharing our capability in research and education in the highest quality partnerships with institutions in both developed and emerging societies. We regard the interplay of academic excellence, social engagement, and societal impact and translation as the hallmarks of a great forward-looking 21st century university. To contribute to this journey, UNSW launched its first EDI Strategy in 2015 and became the first university in Australia to establish the Division of Equity and Diversity in 2017. The UNSW EDI strategy 2022-2025 can be found here.\n\nAccountabilities\n\nLevel B \u2013 Lecturer\n\nSpecific Accountabilities For The Role Level B Lecturer Include\n\u2022 Demonstrate and continuously develop a well-defined teaching philosophy that inspires student learning.\n\u2022 Conduct classes, assess student learning achievements and support students in postgraduate and undergraduate courses in line with UNSW policy.\n\u2022 Design and develop learning activities and resources and provide assessment and feedback using a range of suitable approaches and learning environments.\n\u2022 Initiate the development of experimental approaches to teaching and learning with the support of more senior academics.\n\u2022 Support learning progression with students as individuals (through such activities as one-to-one consultation) and as a cohort (through general course-related advice) to achieve positive learning and employability outcomes for students.\n\u2022 Manage course administration as Course Authority, including academic quality assurance.\n\u2022 Maintain professional development in pedagogy, disciplinary knowledge and minimum professional accreditation requirements (where relevant).\n\u2022 Make a positive contribution to School meetings and seminars and be a member of School/Faculty committees as required.\n\u2022 Engage in individual and/or collaborative research in a manner consistent with disciplinary practice.\n\u2022 Create scholarly impact which is recognised by peers in the advancement of disciplinary knowledge.\n\u2022 Conduct research/scholarly activities under limited supervision, either independently or as a member of a team (as per the norms of the discipline) and design research projects.\n\u2022 Contribute to the development of applications for competitive funding under the guidance of senior colleagues, including participating as co-investigator or chief investigator in competitive grant applications.\n\u2022 Mentor and guide students and colleagues and develop the next generation of academics through involvement in the supervision of HDRs (as per the norms of the discipline).\n\u2022 Align with and actively demonstrate the UNSW Values in Action: Our Behaviours and the UNSW Code of Conduct.\n\u2022 Cooperate with all health and safety policies and procedures of the university and take all reasonable care to ensure that your actions or omissions do not impact the health and safety of yourself or others.\n\nLevel C \u2013 Senior Lecturer\n\nSpecific accountabilities for the role of Level C Senior Lecturer include:\n\u2022 Apply a well-defined teaching philosophy and a critically reflective teaching practice that inspires student learning.\n\u2022 Conduct classes, assess student learning achievements, and support students in both postgraduate and undergraduate courses in line with UNSW policy.\n\u2022 Design and develop learning activities and resources and provide assessment and feedback at both course and program levels using a range of suitable approaches and learning environments.\n\u2022 Support learning progression with students as individuals (through such things as one-to-one consultation) and as a cohort (through general course-related advice) to achieve positive learning and employability outcomes for students.\n\u2022 Manage course administration as Course Authority, including academic quality assurance.\n\u2022 Maintain and develop links within the discipline industry and profession (e.g. contribute to professional development activities).\n\u2022 Work collaboratively to identify and apply for internal education funding opportunities.\n\u2022 Make a positive contribution by leading School meetings and seminars and being a member of School/Faculty committees as required.\n\u2022 Make independent contributions to research that have a significant impact in their field of expertise and create a nationally recognised research track record.\n\u2022 Undertake independent research in a discipline or related area (as per the norms of the discipline), making an independent contribution through professional practice and expertise.\n\u2022 Develop research groups in the area of specialist expertise and research methods that are appropriate to the discipline.\n\u2022 Attract peer recognition and establish research network/s (based on the norms of the discipline) at the national level.\n\u2022 Obtain research income from nationally competitive research grants (and/or research fellowships) and research end-users as a member or leader, at or above the level that is relevant to the discipline in leading universities.\n\u2022 Mentor and guide students, groups, and colleagues;
