Secondly, a passion for social engagement, which improves lives through advancing equality, diversity, open debate, and economic progress. Thirdly, a commitment to achieving societal impact and translation through sharing our capability in research and education in the highest quality partnerships with institutions in both developed and emerging societies. We regard the interplay of academic excellence, social engagement, and societal impact and translation as the hallmarks of a great forward-looking 21st century university.
